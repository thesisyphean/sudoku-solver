# Sudoku Solver

A super simple (~<200 loc) backtracking sudoku solver that uses p5.js for the GUI.
It was used as a first project to start learning JavaScript.

## Execution

Clone the repository and open `index.html`. You might need a local webserver in order for the script to execute though.
Click on a cell to select it and then press a key from <kbd>0-9</kbd> to place it in that cell.
You can then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to solve and <kbd>Space</kbd> to reset the puzzle.
